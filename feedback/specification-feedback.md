Project Specification Feedback
==================

Commit graded: [f4aa9c6ee3fa9d82979b8b089aecad56aca6abd5]

### The product backlog (8/10)

A spreadsheet-like format, rather than prose or bulleted lists, would make your backlogs easier to read. You could also look into online tools for generating and tracking work on a project.

In the future, please add a cost estimate, in hours, for each of the features in your backlog. If the cost estimate is more than 5 or 8 hours or so, consider breaking the feature into smaller work units to improve your ability to track progress on it.

### Data models (9/10)

You can specify the type for each field in your data model.

### Wireframes or mock-ups (9/10)

Generally your wireframes looks good, however it lacks the editing/annotation UI.
